## Install

Add this module as a dev dependency to your project

```sh
npm install --save-dev cypress cypress-failed-log
```

Then include this module from your `cypress/support/index.js` file

```js
// cypress/support/index.js
require('cypress-failed-log')
```

Add an NPM script `failed-test` that will get the name of the JSON file
with failed test details.

```json
// package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "failed-test": "echo Test failed, details in $1"
  }
}
```

You can send the file as an email, upload it somewhere, post to a chat
channel, etc.

## JSON file fields

The saved JSON file will live in `cypress/logs/` and have the following properties (see
[src/index.js](src/index.js#L67))

```
specName - filename of the spec
title - the name of the test
suiteName - the parent suite name
testName - full name of the test, including the suite name
testError - error message string
testCommands - array of strings, last failing command is last
screenshot - filename of PNG file taken right after failure
```

## Example

Here is the failed test JSON file contents. The test name, the failure
and each test command before the test are recorded

```json
{
  "specName": "failing-spec.js",
  "title": "loads the About tab",
  "suiteName": "Website",
  "testName": "Website loads the About tab",
  "testError": "Timed out retrying: Expected to find content: 'Join Us' but never did.",
  "testCommands": [
    "visit",
    "new url https://www.company.com/#/",
    "contains a.nav-link, About",
    "click",
    "new url https://www.company.com/#/about",
    "hash",
    "assert expected **#/about** to equal **#/about**",
    "contains Join Us",
    "assert expected **body :not(script):contains(**'Join Us'**), [type='submit'][value~='Join Us']** to exist in the DOM"
  ],
  "screenshot": "loads-the-about-tab.png"
}
```
