## Install

Add this module as a dev dependency to your project

```sh
npm install --save-dev cypress cypress-failed-log
```

Then include this module from your [cypress/support/index.js](cypress/support/index.js) file

```js
// cypress/support/index.js
require('cypress-failed-log')
```

and in [cypress/plugins/index.js](cypress/plugins/index.js) file add task `failed`

```js
// cypress/plugins/index.js
module.exports = (on, config) => {
  on('task', {
    failed: require('cypress-failed-log/src/failed')(),
  })
}
```

When Cypress runs, you will see commands including the failed one, right in the terminal

## JSON file

In addition, all failed commands will be saved into a JSON file. The saved JSON file will live in `cypress/logs/` and have the following properties:

```
specName - filename of the spec
title - the name of the test
suiteName - the parent suite name
testName - full name of the test, including the suite name
testError - error message string
testCommands - array of strings, last failing command is last
```

## Example

Here is the failed test JSON file contents. The test name, the failure
and each test command before the test are recorded

```json
{
  "specName": "failing-spec.js",
  "title": "loads the About tab",
  "suiteName": "Website",
  "testName": "Website loads the About tab",
  "testError": "Timed out retrying: Expected to find content: 'Join Us' but never did.",
  "testCommands": [
    "visit",
    "new url https://www.company.com/#/",
    "contains a.nav-link, About",
    "click",
    "new url https://www.company.com/#/about",
    "hash",
    "assert expected **#/about** to equal **#/about**",
    "contains Join Us",
    "assert expected **body :not(script):contains(**'Join Us'**), [type='submit'][value~='Join Us']** to exist in the DOM"
  ]
}
```

## Debugging

To turn on [`debug`](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug#readme) messages in the browser, open in Cypress browser DevTools console and enter `localStorage.debug = 'cypress-failed-log'`, then reload the spec. You should see log messages.
